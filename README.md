Overview
GTMØ (Geometry Topology Mathematics Øndefiniteness) is a groundbreaking mathematical framework that formalizes the indefinable aspects of language and meaning through geometric and topological structures. This repository contains the Python implementation of GTMØ theory, which bridges mathematics, linguistics, and cognitive science.
🌟 Key Features

AlienatedNumbers: Mathematical objects capturing indefinite aspects through geometric configuration
9-Dimensional Topological Space: Complete architecture for meaning representation
Adaptive Observation System: Multiple geometric lenses for semantic interpretation
SANB-5 Logic: 5-valued logic system (O, Z, Ø, ∞, Ψ) for handling topological paradoxes
Topological Knowledge Attractors: Dynamic classification in phase space

🚀 Quick Start
pythonfrom gtmo_core_ver3 import UnifiedGTMOSystem, Configuration, AlienatedNumber

# Create GTMØ system
system = UnifiedGTMOSystem()

# Demonstrate lens-based observation
system.demonstrate_lens_based_alienation()

# Create AlienatedNumber - a hybrid of definable and indefinable
alien_num = AlienatedNumber(
    definable="bitcoin_2030",
    configuration=Configuration(position=[0.5, 0.3, 0.7]),
    emergence_strength=0.85
)
🧠 Core Concepts
1. Phase Space Topology (3D)

Determinacy: Geometric certainty (0→1)
Stability: Topological invariance (0→1)
Entropy: Configurational chaos (0→1)

2. Topological Knowledge Types

Ψᴷ - Knowledge Particle (topologically stable)
Ψʰ - Knowledge Shadow (boundary regions)
Ψᴺ - Emergent (topological transitions)
Ø - Singularity (undefined topology)

3. Geometric Observation Lenses

Concatenation Lens (distance-based)
Causal Lens (orientation-based)
Topological Lens (loop detection)
Quantum Lens (superposition states)

📊 Example: Word Trajectory in Configuration Space
python# Track how "virus" moves through topological space over time
word_trajectory = [
    (1900, [0.2, 0.8, 0.1]),  # Low determinacy, high stability
    (1950, [0.8, 0.9, 0.2]),  # Medical definition solidifies
    (1990, [0.6, 0.5, 0.7]),  # "Computer virus" emerges
    (2020, [0.7, 0.3, 0.9])   # COVID + memes = chaos
]
