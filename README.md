Overview
GTM√ò (Geometry Topology Mathematics √òndefiniteness) is a groundbreaking mathematical framework that formalizes the indefinable aspects of language and meaning through geometric and topological structures. This repository contains the Python implementation of GTM√ò theory, which bridges mathematics, linguistics, and cognitive science.
üåü Key Features

AlienatedNumbers: Mathematical objects capturing indefinite aspects through geometric configuration
9-Dimensional Topological Space: Complete architecture for meaning representation
Adaptive Observation System: Multiple geometric lenses for semantic interpretation
SANB-5 Logic: 5-valued logic system (O, Z, √ò, ‚àû, Œ®) for handling topological paradoxes
Topological Knowledge Attractors: Dynamic classification in phase space

üöÄ Quick Start
pythonfrom gtmo_core_v1 import UnifiedGTMOSystem, Configuration, AlienatedNumber

# Create GTM√ò system
system = UnifiedGTMOSystem()

# Demonstrate lens-based observation
system.demonstrate_lens_based_alienation()

# Create AlienatedNumber - a hybrid of definable and indefinable
alien_num = AlienatedNumber(
    definable="bitcoin_2030",
    configuration=Configuration(position=[0.5, 0.3, 0.7]),
    emergence_strength=0.85
)
üß† Core Concepts
1. Phase Space Topology (3D)

Determinacy: Geometric certainty (0‚Üí1)
Stability: Topological invariance (0‚Üí1)
Entropy: Configurational chaos (0‚Üí1)

2. Topological Knowledge Types

Œ®·¥∑ - Knowledge Particle (topologically stable)
Œ® ∞ - Knowledge Shadow (boundary regions)
Œ®·¥∫ - Emergent (topological transitions)
√ò - Singularity (undefined topology)

3. Geometric Observation Lenses

Concatenation Lens (distance-based)
Causal Lens (orientation-based)
Topological Lens (loop detection)
Quantum Lens (superposition states)

üìä Example: Word Trajectory in Configuration Space
python# Track how "virus" moves through topological space over time
word_trajectory = [
    (1900, [0.2, 0.8, 0.1]),  # Low determinacy, high stability
    (1950, [0.8, 0.9, 0.2]),  # Medical definition solidifies
    (1990, [0.6, 0.5, 0.7]),  # "Computer virus" emerges
    (2020, [0.7, 0.3, 0.9])   # COVID + memes = chaos
]
üî¨ Mathematical Applications

Topological Semantics: Mapping meaning through geometric structures
Configuration Dynamics: Tracking semantic evolution in phase space
Emergence Geometry: Formalizing how new meanings arise from configuration limits
Cognitive Topology: Modeling knowledge as topological attractors
